# Subaru Coil On Plug Conversion

There are a few tutorials and guides out there, but they were only a little help when I was doing my conversion, so I wanted to write an easy-to-understand guide on my own. I did the conversion on an MY99 GC8 (EJ205) in this guide. I will leave the Subaru OEM part numbers as I go through the sections.

# Symptoms Of A Bad Ignition Coil

  * Stalling
  * Misfiring
  * Rough idle
  * Reduced engine power
  * The engine vibrates more than it should
  * Rough acceleration / feedback from the throttle

# Understanding the Waste Spark System

Understanding this part will help you comprehend why there are only two signal cables and why we will pair the plugs in pairs.

A wasted spark system is an ignition system used in some four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines. In a wasted spark system, the spark plugs fire in pairs, with one plug in a cylinder on its compression stroke and the other plug in a cylinder on its exhaust stroke. Since one plug is fired on the exhaust stroke, serving no real purpose, the system was known as a “waste spark system.”

# Testing the Coil Packs

You may have found this guide while searching for a fix, and you don't want to do a conversion. Here's how you can test your ignition coil system.

To test the coil pack, you can follow the steps outlined in the picture. If the coil pack is good, but your car is struggling to run, you can also try pulling each coil cable individually from the coil pack to see if the engine reacts in any way while the engine is running. If it does, this indicates that the coil cable is functioning correctly. If the engine does not respond, the coil cable is not working.

# How to Connect the Cables

Before looking at the pins of the sockets, let us understand the process we will go through. You have to connect the **signal**, **ground**, and **12v** cables accordingly, and you'll be good to go.

# Coil Pack Information and the Cylinder Layout

The front cylinders are 1 and 2, and the back cylinders are 3 and 4. Their locations and directions are shown on the coil plug as well.

The model of the coil pack shown in the picture is **Diamond FH0161 (22433AA430)**.

# Pin Layout of the Coil on Plugs

From top to bottom, the pins are **SIGNAL**, **GROUND**, and **12V**, as shown in the picture. The model of the coils I am using is **Diamond FK0334 (22433AA561)**.
